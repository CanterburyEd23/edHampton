# edHampton

This repository contains all of the code for the final two projects of my IT Career Switch course.  These were both developed as mobile-first applications, using Javascript and PHP, and live versions of them can be viewed from my portfolio website at edhampton.co.uk

## Gazetteer App

A virtual gazetteer, essentially a digital version of an old-school encyclopedia.  This app relies on many API calls to provide information on a selected country's weather, currency, population, and more to a user.  It was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, and PHP, along with the leaflet APIs.  It represents a week and half's hard work, and taught me a great deal about Bootstrap in particular in realising a finished product with such a professional appearence.

## Company Directory App

This application is a mock internal company database, allowing for CRUD operations to be performed on lists of employees, departments, and sites.  Again, this was built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and JQuery, with PHP handling calls to a SQL database.  It saw me learn a lot more about working with PHP and SQL in particular, as well as continuing to develop my understanding of Bootstrap.  The result is a simple, smart, minimalist database, easily and intuitivly laid out for any mock-HR team to use.
